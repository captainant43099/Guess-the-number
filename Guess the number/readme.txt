This is a game based on python so yes you can make changes and i cant do a thing about it. Heres a few things to note.
The game will save every round to a folder it makes at the end of the first ever round.
The game may break because well its python.... lol
I will be updating this when i can and the rounds wont be delted but a new python file will be downloaded if you run into issues just trash the old file.
UPDATE: Turtle has been added to the code if you know how to use turtle you can edit the code to use it.
